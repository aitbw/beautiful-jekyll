My name is Angel Perez, a Venezuela-based Information Engineer, Backend
Developer and a Polyglot, as well as an (almost) self-trained, _not-so-amateur_
photographer and a frustrated Sound Engineer.

I'm currently making a living developing _state-of-the-art_ Ruby
applications and getting my hands dirty with JavaScript, Rust and Scala in
order to become some sort of polyglot Backend tailor.

Besides programming, I'm also deeply interested in areas such as art, history,
languages, literature, music (I consider myself a _music-driven_ human being)
and philosophy.

If you'd like to have a coffee or discuss an idea you want to make a reality,
feel free to reach me through any of the links below.

Likewise, if you need to check out my _résumé_ in a more conventional way, you
