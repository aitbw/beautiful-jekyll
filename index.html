<h4 class="text-center">Who am I?</h4>

<p style="text-align:justify">
  My name is Angel Perez, a Colombia-based Information/Engineer and Polyglot,
  as well as an (almost) self-trained, <em>not-so-amateur</em> photographer,
  and a frustrated Sound Engineer.
</p>

<h4 class="text-center">What I do</h4>

<p style="text-align:justify">
  I'm currently making a living crafting <em>state-of-the-art</em> Ruby
  applications, while leading a distributed Engineering team across the Americas
  in a remote fashion amidst a global health crisis. Fun times, huh?
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">
  Besides engineering, I'm also deeply interested in areas such as art, history,
  languages, literature, music (I consider myself a <em>music-driven</em>
  human being), and philosophy.
</p>

<h4 class="text-center">Interested?</h4>
